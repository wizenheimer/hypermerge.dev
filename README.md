A comprehensive platform for measuring engineering productivity and performance, with powerful metrics for sprint management, resource allocation, and engineering ROI optimization.

## Overview

Hypermerge provides visibility into your engineering workflow with data-informed insights. While software development consumes 40-60% of operating budgets across enterprises, it remains largely unmeasured. Hypermerge transforms narrative-driven engineering into metrics-based decision making.

## Features

- **Engineering Metrics Dashboard**: Track cycle time, coding time, review time and other key performance indicators
- **Blocker Detection**: Identify issues before they derail your sprint
- **Resource Allocation Insights**: Visualize where your engineering time is being spent
- **DORA Metrics**: Industry-standard delivery performance measurements
- **Sprint Management Tools**: Make every sprint count with data-driven planning
- **Outcome Tracking**: Drive outcomes, not just output

## Integrations

Hypermerge works seamlessly with your existing tools:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- BitBucket
- Linear
- ClickUp
- Slack

## Use Cases

### End Narrative-Driven Engineering

Stop allowing the most persuasive storytellers to determine resource allocation. Use data to make informed decisions about where to invest engineering resources.

### Measure What Matters

Understand what truly moves your product forward with comprehensive metrics that focus on business value, not just developer activity.

### Ship More, Guess Less

See which efforts actually deliver value and which teams need support based on real performance data, not subjective assessments.

### Drive Outcomes, Not Output

Track investment across features, bugs, and maintenance work to ensure you're building what matters for your customers.
